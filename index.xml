Rethinking Dependence on Dependencies Time spent programming is time spent learning; regardless of one’s opinion on coding projects for job applications, these sorts of projects are good for experimenting.
Have you ever gone to start a project — even a smaller project — and run into immediate decision fatigue? Front end! Should I use React or try Vue? Do I want to use a CSS preprocessor; should I take the opportunity to flaunt some Redux; should I play with something like Pagedraw?</description>

      <description>I see my role as being a problem solver; frameworks and languages are simply tools for creating solutions.

I picked up a programming book, Excel 2010 Power Programming with VBA by John Walkenbach.</description>
